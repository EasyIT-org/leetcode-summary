- Difficulty: Medium
- Topics: Database
- Slug: friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends
- Problem ID: 602

## Description
Table: RequestAccepted
Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.
The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

## Examples
### Example 1
```text
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
```


## Constraints

## Hints
- Being friends is bidirectional. If you accept someone's adding friend request, both you and the other person will have one more friend.

## Follow Ups
- In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?
