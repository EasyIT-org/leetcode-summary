# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

- Difficulty: Easy
- Topics: Binary Search, Interactive
- Slug: guess-number-higher-or-lower
- Problem ID: 374

## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
Return the number that I picked.
Example 1:
Example 2:
Example 3:
Constraints:

## Examples
### Example 1
```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```


## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
- 1 <= pick <= n
