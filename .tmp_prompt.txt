Task: Extract 3-7 key techniques used to solve the LeetCode problem below.
- Use concise lowercase phrases (e.g., "hash map", "two pointers", "binary search").
- Prefer common algorithm/data-structure technique names.
- Return STRICT JSON only (no markdown, no extra commentary).

Return JSON schema:
{
  "frontend_id": 866,
  "title": "Prime Palindrome",
  "techniques": ["technique 1", "technique 2"]
}

Problem:
Title: Prime Palindrome
Frontend ID: 866
Slug: prime-palindrome
Difficulty: Medium

Description:
Given an integer n, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to n.
An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Note that 1 is not a prime number.
An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.
The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range [2, 2 * 108].
Example 1:
Example 2:
Example 3:
Constraints:

Examples:
Input: n = 6
Output: 7

Input: n = 8
Output: 11

Input: n = 13
Output: 101

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 108
